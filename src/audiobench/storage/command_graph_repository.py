"""Command graph repository — queries over command_events and workflows.

This module provides the intelligence layer reads:
- Pattern detection: what commands follow what commands
- Workflow CRUD: save, list, get, delete named command sequences
- Structural NL parsing: turn a ?-question into a SQLite query fast-path
